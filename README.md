# Predictive Modeling for Personal Loan Conversion in The Bank's Customer Base

## Project Background
Thera-Bank, a leading financial institution, primarily caters to a large base of deposit customers. However, the proportion of customers who are also borrowers—referred to as asset customers—remains relatively small. As a strategic initiative, the bank aims to expand this segment to increase revenue from loan interest while retaining its customers as depositors.

Last year, the bank launched a retail loan campaign targeting its deposit customers. The campaign achieved a modest conversion rate of 9.6%. While this was a step forward, it highlighted the need for a more focused and efficient approach to identify potential customers for personal loans.

The retail marketing team at Thera-Bank recognizes the importance of targeted marketing to improve the success rate of these campaigns without exceeding the budget. With limited resources, it is crucial to prioritize high-potential customers, ensuring effective allocation of campaign efforts. By leveraging historical data and advanced analytics, the bank seeks to develop a predictive model that classifies customers likely to accept personal loans.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design, build, and evaluate a machine learning-based classifier capable of identifying potential retail loan customers from Thera-Bank’s deposit customer base. This predictive model will assist the marketing team in:

Enhancing Campaign Efficiency: By focusing on high-potential customers, the bank can improve the success rate of its loan campaigns.
Reducing Costs: Targeted marketing minimizes expenditure by reducing outreach to customers less likely to convert.
Supporting Data-Driven Decision-Making: Providing actionable insights to the retail marketing department to refine their strategies.

## Key Features of the Project
Dataset: The project uses the Thera-Bank dataset, which contains customer demographic, financial, and behavioral data.
Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, transforming, and handling imbalanced classes to ensure a robust model.
Modeling Approach: Machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are evaluated.
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC are used to assess the model’s ability to differentiate between potential borrowers and non-borrowers.
By achieving these objectives, the project will not only support Thera-Bank’s business goals but also serve as a case study in the application of machine learning for targeted marketing in the banking industry.
